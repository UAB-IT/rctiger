            <dd class="mt-2 text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">Cheaha is a supercomputer located at the University of Alabama Birmingham (UAB). It is currently the largest and fastest supercomputer in the state of Alabama. Cheaha offers high performance computing resources to researchers across many disciplines and institutions. It can handle data-intensive, computational research projects that would not be feasible on a typical desktop or lab computer.</dd>

            <dt class="text-base font-semibold leading-7 text-gray-900">How do I get access to Cheaha?</dt>
            <dd class="mt-2 text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">To gain access to Cheaha, you will need to request an account through the UAB IT Research Computing group. Accounts are available to faculty, staff, and students at UAB as well as external collaborators. The account request process involves submitting basic information about your research project and intended Cheaha usage. This helps determine the appropriate resource allocation and storage quotas for your work.</dd>

            <dd class="mt-2 text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">Cheaha supports a wide variety of scientific research software via Environment Modules. This includes programming languages like R, Python, MATLAB, development tools, math libraries, deep learning frameworks, and domain-specific packages for chemistry, biology, engineering, and more. Before running a program, you will need to load the required modules into your environment.</dd>

            <dd class="mt-2 text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">Cheaha accounts can be created for external collaborators from other universities, companies, or research institutes to facilitate sharing data and compute resources. The process involves the UAB primary investigator submitting a request through the XIA system (External Identity and Access). This allows creating a unique Cheaha identity for the external user while still tracking their affiliation and resource usage.</dd>
